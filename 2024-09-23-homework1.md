## Difference Acronym and Abbreviation

They are pretty close but there is a major difference.
Both are shortened forms of words but:

- **Abbreviations** are letters taken from the word but it does not always create a new pronounceable word.
- **Acronyms** take the first letters of each word in the phrase and create a new pronounceable word.

## Examples

### Abbreviations

Mr. is an abbreviation for Mister.
Dr. is an abbreviation for Doctor.
Etc. is an abbreviation for Et cetera.

When you read those abbreviations you will say the real word instead of the abbreviation.

### Acronyms

FBI is an acronym for **F**ederal **B**ureau of **I**nvestigation.
NASA is an acronym for **National** **A**eronautics and **S**pace **A**dministration.
WHO is an acronym for **W**orld **H**ealth **O**rganization.

When you read those acronyms you will say the acronym instead of the real word.

There are also lots of used words that are actually acronyms but people dont know that they are acronyms.
for example Radar is an acronym for **RA**dio **D**etection **A**nd **R**anging.

## Punctuation and Capitalization

### Uppercase

1. Start of a sentence like this one.
2. Names of people, places, and things. "I am French, I live in Paris, and my name is Dante." (I is capitalized when you are talking about yourself)
3. Titles of books, movies, and songs. "I watched The Matrix last night."

### Lowercase

Everything else.

### Punctuation

1. Periods: . (end of a sentence)
2. Question marks: ? (end of a question)
3. Exclamation marks: ! (end of an exclamation)
4. Commas: , (separate words in a list or long sentence)
5. Colons: : (introduce a list or explanation)
6. Quotation marks: " " (show that someone is speaking, quote a text)
7. Apostrophes: ' (show possession or contractions)
8. Semi colons: ; (separate two independent clauses)

## common terms

### e.g. (exempli gratia)

Means "for example" in Latin.
Use it when giving specific examples of something.
"I like pasta, e.g., spaghetti."

### i.e. (id est)

Means "that is" in Latin.
Use it to clarify or explain something.
"I'm a vegetarian, i.e., I don't eat meat."

### etc. (et cetera)

Means "and so forth" in Latin.
Use it at the end of a list to show that there are other things that could be included.
"I like pasta, pizza, etc."

### How to use them in formal writing

- Use e.g. and i.e. with a comma after them.
- Avoid overusing etc. in formal writing. It can make your writing seem lazy or unclear.
- e.g. gives examples, i.e. clarifies, etc. shows there are more things.

## Something to add?

Im going to make it more confusing.
When it comes to acronyms and abbreviations the United States can be both.
USA is an acronym for **U**nited **S**tates of **A**merica.
U.S.A. is an abbreviation for United States of America.
