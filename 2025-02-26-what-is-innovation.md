# What is Innovation

## Academic Definition

It’s the **systematic process** of translating **novel ideas** into products, services, or processes that **create value** and induce change. Scholarly sources (like the OECD Oslo Manual) define it as the **introduction of a new or significantly improved product, process, marketing method, or organizational method**. Schumpeter famously dubbed it the “**industrial mutation**” that revolutionizes economic structures.

**Key takeaway**: Novelty + Value creation = Innovation.

- Two Major Components

  1. Invention
  2. Commercialization

- Doing Something **New** and **Valuable**
