## Question 2

### What are the primary differences among deep learning frameworks: Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch?

#### Keras

- **Easy to Use**: Keras is designed to be simple and user-friendly, making it ideal for beginners who want to quickly build and test models.
- **Works with TensorFlow**: Keras is integrated with TensorFlow, which helps in deploying models in production environments.

#### TensorFlow

- **Flexible**: TensorFlow is a powerful framework that provides more control over building complex models, suitable for both research and production.
- **Scalable**: It is optimized for handling large datasets and models, often used in industries and enterprise-level applications.

#### PyTorch

- **Beginner-Friendly**: PyTorch is considered more intuitive due to its simpler syntax and real-time execution, which makes it easy for beginners to learn and experiment.
- **Great for Research**: PyTorch is widely used in academia because it allows flexibility for experimenting with new ideas and models.

### Which framework do you prefer and why? Explain with an example

At this stage, I don’t really have a strong preference for any framework since I haven’t used any of them extensively. However, based on what I’ve heard, PyTorch seems to be more beginner-friendly compared to TensorFlow. PyTorch is often praised for its simpler syntax and dynamic computation graph, which makes it easier to learn and experiment with, especially when starting with deep learning.
