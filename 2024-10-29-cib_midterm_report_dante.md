# Communication in Business Midterm Report: Adaptive Music in Video Games

## Introduction

### Definition of Adaptive Music

Adaptive music in video games is music that changes based on what's happening in the game.
Unlike traditional soundtracks, it adjusts to events or actions, creating a closer connection between the player and the game.

### Importance of Music in Video Games

This subject is intriguing to me because it shows how even small details, like music, are crucial to building an immersive experience.
Just as a movie's music shapes emotions and heightens engagement adaptive music in games makes the experience feel more real and impactful, illustrating the importance of sound in creating memorable and dynamic worlds.

Research indicates that music in video games significantly influences player immersion and emotional responses.
A study published in [_The journal of Sound and Music in Games_](https://online.ucpress.edu/jsmg/article/2/4/13/118800/LudomusicologyNormalizing-the-Study-of-Video-Game) found that adaptive music enhances the gaming experience by aligning musical cues with gameplay events, thereby increasing player engagement and emotional resonance.

Moreover, adaptive music serves as a narrative device, guiding players through the game's story and reinforcing the emotional tone of various scenes.
For example, in the game _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild_, _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_ or _Skyrim_, the music dynamically shifts to reflect the player's actions and the environment, creating a cohesive and immersive experience.

Incorporating adaptive music into video games not only enhances immersion but also creates a more engaging and emotionally resonant experience for players.
Players often say that very immersive games are like movies, and the music is a big part of that.

## Evolution of Music in Video Games

The progression of music in video games has been instrumental in shaping the immersive experiences players enjoy today. Initially, game music was static and limited by technological constraints, but it has evolved into complex, adaptive soundscapes that respond dynamically to gameplay.

### Early Static Music vs. Adaptive Music

In the early days of gaming, music was often a simple, unchanging loop due to hardware limitations.
For example, the 1978 game Space Invaders featured a repetitive four-note loop that increased i tempo as enemies approached, adding tension despite the simplicity.
This can be considered an early form of adaptive music, as the soundtrack responded to in-game events.

As technology advanced, game designers/composers began creating more complex and dynamic soundtracks. Most games now feature adaptive music that changes based on player actions, environmental factors, and narrative progression.

### Key Milestones in Game Music Evolution

- **1980s**: The use of programmable sound generators in consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) allowed for more varied and complex compositions. Games like _Super Mario Bros_ featured memorable melodies that became iconic.
- **1990s**: The advent of CD-ROM technology enabled the use of recorded audio, leading to richer and more immersive soundtracks. Games like _Final Fantasy VII_ utilized orchestral scores to enhance storytelling.
- **2000s**: The implementation of adaptive music systems became more prevalent. For example, _Halo 2_ Featured a dynamic soundtrack that responded to in game events, intensifying the player's experience.
- **2010s and Beyond**: Advances in audio technology and game design have enabled even more sophisticated adaptive music systems. Games like _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_ and _Red Dead Redemption 2_ feature dynamic soundtracks that enhance immersion and emotional impact depending on the players choices.

As technology continues to advance, the potential for even more dynamic and responsive game music grows, promising richer experiences for players.
