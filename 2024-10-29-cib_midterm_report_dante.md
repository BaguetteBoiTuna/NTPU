# Communication in Business Midterm Report: Adaptive Music in Video Games

## Introduction

### Definition of Adaptive Music

Adaptive music also called dynamic music in video games is music that changes based on what's happening in the game.
Unlike traditional soundtracks, it adjusts to events or actions, creating a closer connection between the player and the game.

### Importance of Music in Video Games

This subject is intriguing to me because it shows how even small details, like music, are crucial to building an immersive experience. Just as a movie's music shapes emotions and heightens engagement adaptive music in games makes the experience feel more real and impactful, illustrating the importance of sound in creating memorable and dynamic worlds.

Research indicates that music in video games significantly influences player immersion and emotional responses.
A study published in [_The journal of Sound and Music in Games_](https://online.ucpress.edu/jsmg/article/2/4/13/118800/LudomusicologyNormalizing-the-Study-of-Video-Game) found that adaptive music enhances the gaming experience by aligning musical cues with gameplay events, thereby increasing player engagement and emotional resonance.

Moreover, adaptive music serves as a narrative device, guiding players through the game's story and reinforcing the emotional tone of various scenes. For example, in the game _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild_, _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_ or _Skyrim_, the music dynamically shifts to reflect the player's actions and the environment, creating a cohesive and immersive experience.

Incorporating adaptive music into video games not only enhances immersion but also creates a more engaging and emotionally resonant experience for players. Players often say that very immersive games are like movies, and the music is a big part of that.

## Evolution of Music in Video Games

The progression of music in video games has been instrumental in shaping the immersive experiences players enjoy today. Initially, game music was static and limited by technological constraints, but it has evolved into complex, adaptive soundscapes that respond dynamically to gameplay.

### Early Static Music vs. Adaptive Music

In the early days of gaming, music was often a simple, unchanging loop due to hardware limitations.
For example, the 1978 game Space Invaders featured a repetitive four-note loop that increased in tempo as enemies approached, adding tension despite the simplicity. This can be considered an early form of adaptive music, as the soundtrack responded to in-game events.

As technology advanced, game designers/composers began creating more complex and dynamic soundtracks. Most games now feature adaptive music that changes based on player actions, environmental factors, and narrative progression.

### Key Milestones in Game Music Evolution

- **1980s**: The use of programmable sound generators in consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) allowed for more varied and complex compositions. Games like _Super Mario Bros_ featured memorable melodies that became iconic.
- **1990s**: The advent of CD-ROM technology enabled the use of recorded audio, leading to richer and more immersive soundtracks. Games like _Final Fantasy VII_ utilized orchestral scores to enhance storytelling.
- **2000s**: The implementation of adaptive music systems became more prevalent. For example, _Halo 2_ Featured a dynamic soundtrack that responded to in game events, intensifying the player's experience.
- **2010s and Beyond**: Advances in audio technology and game design have enabled even more sophisticated adaptive music systems. Games like _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_ and _Red Dead Redemption 2_ feature dynamic soundtracks that enhance immersion and emotional impact depending on the players choices.

As technology continues to advance, the potential for even more dynamic and responsive game music grows, promising richer experiences for players.

## What is Adaptive Music?

### Explanation of Adaptive Music

Adaptive music, also known as dynamic or interactive music, refers to soundtracks that change in real-time in response to player actions or in game events. Unlike traditional static music, which remains constant regardless of what's going on, adaptive music evolves to reflect the game's current state, enhancing immersion and emotional engagement. This approach allows the music to change in intensity, instrumentation and even composition based on gameplay elements, enhancing the emotional experience and immersion of the user.

### Types of Adaptive Music in Games

#### Dynamic Soundtracks

These are compositions that adjust their intensity, tempo or instrumentation based on the game's action.
For example, during combat, the music may become more intense, while in exploration phases, it might be more subdued.

#### Contextual Music Changes

This type involves altering the music to match specific in game contexts or environments.
For instance, entering a peaceful village might trigger a calm melody, whereas venturing into a dangerous area could cue ominous tones.

#### Branching Music Structures

In this approach, the music follows different paths or branches depending on player choices or game outcomes, creating a personalized auditory experience.

#### Layered Music

This technique involves stacking multiple musical layers that can be added or removed based on gameplay. For example, a base layer might play continuously, with additional layers introduced during heightened action or tension. This approach allows the music to change in intensity, instrumentation and even composition based on gameplay elements.

Implementing adaptive music requires careful composition and technical integration to ensure seamless transitions and maintain the desired emotional impact. When executed effectively, it significantly enhances the player's connection to the game world.

## Impact on Player Experience

We already know that the goal of Adaptive music is to enhance the player's immersion significantly. But how does it achieve this? And what are the feedbacks from the players and developers?

### Immersion and Emotional Response

Let's use _Red Dead Redemption 2_ (RDR2) as an example.

RDR2 is an open world action adventure game set in the American Wild West, where players navigate a vast landscape, interacting with characters and environments that reflect the challenges and atmosphere of the 1899 frontier.
The game's adaptive music, composed by [Woody Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Jackson), dynamically shifts to achieve a cinematic experience.

#### Dynamic Musical Adaptation

As said before the music in RDR2 changes based on the player's location and actions.
For example, as players explore the open fields or mountains, ambient and subdued music sets a peaceful tone, enhancing the feeling of solitude in the wilderness. When players enter gunfights or intense chases, the music seamlessly transitions to a faster more intense rhythm, aligning with the adrenaline and urgency of the moment. This adaptation helps make the game world feel more responsive and alive, drawing players deeper into the experience.

#### Emotional Resonance

Beyond immersion, the adaptive music in RDR2 amplifies the emotional impact of the story. The game's narrative follows Arthur Morgan, an outlaw grappling with loyalty, survival and redemption. During significant plot points, the music shifts to reflect Arthur's internal struggles and the gravity of his choices. For example, soft, melancholic melodies might play during reflective moments, reinforcing themes of loss and introspection, while triumphant scores may accompany moments of success or escape. This alignment between music and narrative draws players deeper into Arthur's journey, making his experiences feel more personal and meaningful.

#### Technical Implementation

The seamless music transition in RDR2 are achieved through sophisticated audio technology, allowing music to adapt in real time based on gameplay events. This context sensitive scoring system ensures that changes in music flow naturally, maintaining the immersive atmosphere without breaking it with sudden shifts. This level of musical responsiveness makes players feel as if the world is actively reacting to them.

#### Recognition and Awards

The exceptional quality of RDR2's music has been recognized with several awards. At The Game Awards 2018, the game won [Best Score/Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWEIklwCX_Q), highlighting the impact of its adaptive soundtrack.
