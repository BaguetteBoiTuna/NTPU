# Controller Area Network (CAN)

**Overview**  
The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a serial communication protocol developed by Bosch in 1986. It is primarily used in the automotive and industrial sectors to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with one another without needing a central host computer. CAN is designed for reliable, high-speed data exchange in noisy environments such as vehicles.

**Key Features**

- **Differential Signal**: CAN uses two wires, **CAN High (CANH)** and **CAN Low (CANL)**, to transmit data. This setup provides robustness against electrical noise and ensures reliable communication.
- **Message-Based Communication**: CAN operates with messages known as **data frames**, each containing priority information, error detection via CRC, and acknowledgment bits. CAN's decentralized system allows any node to transmit data, with all other nodes listening.
- **Error Detection and Correction**: CAN incorporates multiple mechanisms, including **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**, to detect errors and automatically retransmit data if needed.
- **Prioritization**: Messages are prioritized by their identifier, with lower identifier numbers having higher priority to ensure that critical messages are transmitted first.

**Types of CAN Protocols**

- **CAN 2.0A**: Uses an 11-bit identifier, suitable for simpler systems.
- **CAN 2.0B**: Uses a 29-bit identifier, ideal for more complex systems that require finer message prioritization.
- **CAN FD (Flexible Data-rate)**: Introduced in 2012, this version allows for higher data rates and larger data payloads (up to 64 bytes), making it more suitable for modern applications.

**Applications**

- **Automotive**: CAN is essential for connecting ECUs in vehicles, managing systems such as engine control, airbags, transmission, ABS, and power steering. It also supports advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) for features like collision avoidance and lane-keeping.
- **Industrial Automation**: CAN is widely used in factory automation and machinery control, where sensors and actuators communicate through the network.
- **Aviation and Marine**: CAN is applied in control systems for both aerospace and maritime navigation, where reliability is crucial in high-noise environments.

**How CAN Works**  
In a CAN network, each node can send and receive messages. The network operates on a bus topology, where all nodes share the same data line. Messages are prioritized based on their identifier, with higher-priority messages transmitted first. Error detection ensures the reliability of the communication, even in electrically noisy conditions.
