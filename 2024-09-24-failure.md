# Failure

**Overview**  
In engineering and safety-critical systems, failure refers to the **inability of a system, component, or process to perform its intended function**. Failures can be categorized into various types, such as **systematic** and **random**, and can occur due to hardware defects, software bugs, environmental stress, or human error. Failure analysis is essential in improving system reliability, safety, and resilience, and is a key focus in standards like **IEC 61508**.

**Types of Failure**

- **Systematic Failures**: Caused by flaws in the system design, implementation, or configuration. These failures are repeatable and can often be predicted based on design weaknesses.
  - **Example**: A software bug that causes a consistent crash when a certain input is received.
- **Random Failures**: Occur due to unpredictable factors, such as hardware degradation or environmental stress. These failures cannot be reliably predicted based on design alone.
  - **Example**: A resistor failing due to prolonged exposure to high temperatures.
- **Common Cause Failures (CCF)**: Failures that affect multiple system components simultaneously due to a single root cause.
  - **Example**: A power surge that damages multiple electronic components in a control system.

**Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)**  
FMEA is a structured approach used to identify potential failure modes, assess their impact, and prioritize corrective actions. It is commonly used in automotive, aerospace, and medical industries to enhance product reliability.

- **Failure Mode**: The manner in which a component or system could potentially fail.
  - **Example**: An actuator may fail by jamming or losing power.
- **Effect**: The consequence of a failure mode on the system or process.
  - **Example**: A jammed actuator could lead to the failure of an aircraft's landing gear to deploy.
- **Criticality**: The severity of the failure's impact, often categorized as low, medium, or high.

**Key Concepts in Failure Analysis**

- **Failure Rate (λ)**: The probability that a system or component will fail in a given time period, often measured in failures per million hours (FIT - Failures In Time).
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: A reliability measure that represents the average time between system failures.
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: A method used to identify the underlying cause of a failure. RCA typically involves iterative investigation until the most fundamental cause is identified.

**Failure in Safety-Critical Systems**  
For safety-critical systems, failure can lead to catastrophic outcomes, including loss of life or significant environmental damage. As such, these systems are designed with multiple layers of **[fault tolerance](2024-09-10-fault-tolerance.md)** and **redundancy** to mitigate the risks associated with failure.

- **[Fault Tolerance](2024-09-10-fault-tolerance.md)**: The ability of a system to continue operating correctly even if some of its components fail.
  - **Example**: A redundant communication bus in an airplane ensures that if one bus fails, another can take over.
- **Fail-Safe Design**: A design approach that ensures a system transitions to a safe state in the event of failure.
  - **Example**: Railway signaling systems that automatically stop trains if communication is lost.

**Failure Metrics**

- **[Safety Integrity Levels (SIL)](2024-09-24-sil.md)**: Defines the necessary safety measures based on the probability of dangerous failures (as defined in IEC 61508).
- **Failure Modes, Effects, and Diagnostic Analysis (FMEDA)**: An extension of FMEA, which also includes diagnostic coverage to detect or prevent failures.

**Case Studies**

1. **Therac-25 Incident**: A radiation therapy machine caused multiple patient deaths due to software failure that went undetected during testing.
2. **Northeast Blackout of 2003**: A cascading failure in the power grid caused by inadequate system monitoring and failure to properly manage the growing load demand.
