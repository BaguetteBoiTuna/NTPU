## Abstract

This report explores the application of AI-powered eco-driving strategies in autonomous electric vehicles (EVs) to enhance energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and improve urban mobility. By leveraging Vehicle-to-Environment (V2E) communication systems and advanced machine learning algorithms, the project demonstrates how real-time data-driven decisions can optimize driving patterns, extend battery life, and reduce operational costs. A simulation-based approach validates the feasibility and impact of the proposed solution, comparing AI-driven eco-driving to conventional methods. The findings underscore the potential of integrating intelligent systems in EVs to address pressing environmental and economic challenges while advancing sustainable transportation.

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has brought forth new challenges in optimizing energy efficiency to reduce operational costs and environmental impact. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising strategies for real-time eco-driving in autonomous EVs, developing fully functional AI systems requires significant resources and infrastructure. For this project, we focused on implementing a simplified algorithm within a simulated environment to demonstrate the feasibility and impact of AI-like eco-driving strategies.

### Objectives

This project aims to:

1. Explore the principles of energy-efficient eco-driving using algorithmic approaches.
2. Leverage Vehicle-to-Environment (V2E) communication concepts to improve driving efficiency in real-time within a simulated environment.
3. Validate the proposed solution through a simulation built in GODOT, showcasing the energy-saving potential of intelligent driving patterns.
