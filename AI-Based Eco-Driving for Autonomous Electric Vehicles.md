## Relevance to Our Project

In our project, we utilized the Godot Engine a free and open-source game engine renowned for its versatility in 2D and 3D game development to create a simulation environment for testing eco-driving strategies in autonomous EVs.

While our approach did not involve complex machine learning models, the flexibility of Godot enabled us to script decision-making algorithms that adjust driving behaviors based on simulated environmental inputs, such as traffic signals and road conditions.

Employing Godot provided a practical platform to demonstrate the principles of eco-driving and the potential benefits of AI integration in autonomous EVs.
