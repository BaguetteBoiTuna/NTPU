# Automotive Electronic Systems

## Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs)

### Key Features

1. **Remote Operation**
   - Operate remotely without a crew.
2. **Autonomous Tasks**
   - Perform repetitive or dangerous work independently.

### Motivations

1. **Safety Limitations**
   - Cannot guarantee 100% safety with current autonomous systems.
2. **Real-Time Remote Control**
   - Remote control systems help solve traffic corner cases through video transmission.

- Self-driving vehicles struggle with awkward or unusual situations.
- **Need for Low-Latency Systems**
  - Essential for control and transmission.
- **Reliable Control Servers**
  - Must be cloud-based, secure, and dependable.
