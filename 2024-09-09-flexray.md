# FlexRay

A FlexRay bus is a type of high-speed communication system used in modern cars to connect various electronic components, such as sensors, control units, and actuators. Think of it like a highway for data, allowing different parts of a vehicle to exchange information quickly and reliably. This is especially important for critical functions like steering and braking, where delays or errors in communication could be dangerous.

FlexRay is designed to be fast (up to 10 Mbps) and fault-tolerant, meaning it can keep working even if some parts of the network fail. It achieves this by using a dual-channel setup, so if one communication path fails, the other can take over. Additionally, FlexRay uses a time-division system, which means each part of the vehicle has its own specific time slot to send data, ensuring that messages don't collide with each other.

Unlike older systems like [CAN](2024-09-09-can.md) (Controller Area Network), FlexRay is more suitable for handling complex, safety-critical tasks in cars, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and drive-by-wire technologiesâ€‹
