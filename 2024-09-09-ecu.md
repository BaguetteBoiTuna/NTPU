# ECU

An ECU (Engine Control Unit) is like the brain of a car's engine. It controls how the engine works by managing things like fuel, air, and spark to ensure the car runs smoothly. The ECU gets information from sensors around the car and makes adjustments to improve performance, fuel efficiency, and reduce emissions. It's basically the computer that keeps your engine working properly.
