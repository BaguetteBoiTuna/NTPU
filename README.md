# NTPU Obsidian Notes Repository

This repository contains my Obsidian setup for note-taking, primarily focused on the courses I have taken at National Taipei University (NTPU). All the notes, assignments, and related materials from my academic journey at NTPU are documented here.

## Recommended Software

To fully explore and navigate these notes, it is highly recommended to use **Obsidian**, as it allows for easy access to linked notes and supports Obsidian’s unique note-linking features. Using Obsidian will enable you to get the most out of the interconnected structure of these notes.

## How to Get Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open **Obsidian**.
3. Use Obsidian’s "Open folder as vault" feature to open this repository.
4. Begin exploring by opening the `Knowledge Hub.md` file, which serves as the entry point to all the notes.

## Structure

- **Course Notes**: Notes are organized by course, each linked to relevant topics, references, and additional materials.
- **Knowledge Hub**: This is the starting point for navigating the repository. It contains links to all major topics, courses, and resources.

Feel free to explore and learn more about the topics covered during my time at NTPU!
