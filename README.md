# NTPU Obsidian Notes Repository

This repository contains my Obsidian setup for note-taking, primarily focused on the courses I have taken at National Taipei University (NTPU). All the notes, assignments, and related materials from my academic journey at NTPU are documented here.

## Required Software

To properly view and navigate these notes, **Obsidian** is essential. Without it, accessing the interlinked notes and navigating through the material would be difficult and cumbersome. Obsidian's unique note-linking and organizational features are integral to the structure of this repository, and attempting to explore it without Obsidian will result in a suboptimal and frustrating experience.

## How to Get Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open **Obsidian**.
3. Use Obsidianâ€™s "Open folder as vault" feature to open this repository.
4. Begin exploring by opening the `Knowledge Hub.md` file, which serves as the entry point to all the notes.

## Structure

- **Course Notes**: Notes are organized by course, each linked to relevant topics, references, and additional materials.
- **Knowledge Hub**: This is the starting point for navigating the repository. It contains links to all major topics, courses, and resources.

Feel free to explore and learn more about the topics covered during my time at NTPU!
