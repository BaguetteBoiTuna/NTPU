## Relationship to Other Courses

This course complements:

- [Introduction to Intelligent Electronics](2024-09-09-introduction_to_intelligent_electronics.md)
- [Automotive Intelligent Electronic Systems - Introduction](2024-09-09-automotive-intelligent-electronic-systems---introduction.md)
- [Design and Application of Intelligent Electronics](2024-09-09-design_and_application_of_intelligent_electronics.md)

## Importance of New Communication Network Standards

- **Rapid Increase in Automotive Functions**
  - Future systems require advanced communication infrastructures.
- **Requirements for New Communication Backbones**:
  - **High Bandwidth**: Essential for real-time applications.
  - **Determinism**: Simplifies realization of distributed control applications.
  - **[Fault Tolerance](2024-09-10-fault-tolerance.md)**: Crucial for safety-critical applications.

## Network Topologies

### [Passive Bus Topology](2024-09-14-network-topologies.md#^passive-bus-topology)

- **Description**: Classic linear bus where all nodes share the same communication medium.
- **Issue**: Vulnerable to a "babbling idiot" node.
  - **Babbling Idiot**: A faulty node that continuously transmits, occupying the bus and preventing others from communicating.
- **Advantage**: Cost-effective solution.
- **Disadvantage**: Lack of fault isolation can lead to network failure.

### [Active Star Topology](2024-09-14-network-topologies.md#^active-star-topology)

- **Description**: Central hub (star) connects to each node individually.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Fault Isolation**: Can isolate and manage faulty nodes, preventing network disruption.
  - **High Communication Flow Handling**: Central node manages traffic efficiently.
- **Disadvantage**: More expensive due to additional hardware requirements.

## [Intrinsic vs. Functional Safety](2024-09-14-safety-concepts.md)

### Intrinsic Safety

- **Goal**: Reduce or eliminate causes of harm entirely.
- **Example**: Separating a road and railway crossing by constructing an overpass or underpass.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Ensures absolute safety.
  - Involves large-scale, often expensive changes.

### Functional Safety

- **Goal**: Introduce safety functions to achieve an acceptable risk level.
- **Example**: Installing crossing alarms and barriers at a road-rail intersection.
- **Characteristics**:
  - More cost-effective.
  - Requires consideration of all possible failure causes.
  - Relies on proper functioning of safety mechanisms and user compliance.

## [Fault Tolerance](2024-09-10-fault-tolerance.md) - Basic Definition

- **Fault-Tolerant Systems**: Systems designed to continue functioning correctly even in the presence of faults.
- **Reality**:
  - Flawless execution under all circumstances is impossible.
  - Focus on likely failures and errors to mitigate.

## Need for [Fault Tolerance](2024-09-10-fault-tolerance.md)

### Critical Applications

- **Domains**:
  - Aircraft
  - Nuclear reactors
  - Chemical plants
  - Medical equipment
  - Financial systems
- **Reasons**:
  - Malfunctions can lead to catastrophic consequences.
  - Extremely low failure probabilities required (e.g., one in a billion hours).

### Harsh Environments

- **Conditions**:
  - Electromagnetic disturbances.
  - Particle radiation (e.g., cosmic rays).
- **Impact**:
  - High failure rates without fault tolerance.
  - Fault tolerance ensures system usefulness.

### Highly Complex Systems

- **Characteristics**:
  - Consist of millions of components.
  - Each component has a non-zero failure probability.
- **Challenge**:
  - High likelihood of faults due to the sheer number of devices.
  - Fault tolerance prevents frequent failures from rendering the system useless.

## Faults, Errors, and Failures

- **Fault**:
  - Physical defect or flaw in hardware or software components.
  - Examples:
    - Shorts or opens in electrical conductors.
    - Software bugs like infinite loops.
- **Error**:
  - Manifestation of a fault during system operation.
- **Failure**:
  - Deviation of the system from its intended function due to errors.

## Hardware Fault Classification

### Types of Faults

1. **Transient Faults**

   - **Nature**: Temporary; disappear after a short time.
   - **Causes**: External disturbances like electromagnetic interference.
   - **Example**: Memory cell content altered spuriously.
   - **Mitigation**: Rewriting correct data restores functionality.

2. **Permanent Faults**

   - **Nature**: Persistent; component requires repair or replacement.
   - **Causes**: Physical damage, wear-out mechanisms.
   - **Example**: Burnt-out transistor.

3. **Intermittent Faults**

   - **Nature**: Occur sporadically; difficult to predict.
   - **Causes**: Marginal design, unstable components.
   - **Challenge**: Hard to detect and diagnose.
