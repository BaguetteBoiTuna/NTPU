# Exchange Year at National Taipei University

## 1. Why Taiwan, Why NTPU

I chose Taiwan because I never went to Taiwan before and who would say no to safe cities, great food, and affordable living. I wanted to choose something new and thought, "Why not?" National Taipei University looked ideal: a green campus in Sanxia, tech electives for a CS major, and business classes to patch my knowledge gap. Photos of Mind Lake and the brick-and-glass buildings persuaded me to book my tickets. I landed on **29 August** with one suitcase and the goal of pairing code skills with some real-world commerce.

## 2. Academic Experience

The stand-out lecturers were Prof. Min-Yuh Day (tech courses) and Prof. Maureen Li (communication). Their constant feedback on slide design, storytelling, and delivery turned my presentations from functional to polished. Workload felt fair: regular assignments, no all-night crunch. I left each semester with stronger speaking skills and a few decks I am genuinely proud to show recruiters.

## 3. Campus and Facilities

NTPU buildings each project a distinct mood: Law feels marble-quiet, IT is bright and utilitarian, the Business school almost resembles a boutique hotel (a bit I cant really explain it). **The food court has a FamilyMart and rows of budget stalls.** A **7-Eleven inside the Business building** for emergency caffeine and snacks between class hours. Best perk: the rooftop above the food court, perfect for catching a breeze or a legal beer after class.

My room was in **Glorious Morn** and everyone loved it for one reason: **air-conditioning**. Four of us shared the space, but during humid nights the only thing that mattered was that AC unit humming. I rarely used the main library; all study sessions happened at my desk, headphones on, sometimes a bubble-tea.

## 4. Social Life

**Friday nights were for live-music bars in Taipei.** We would bus in, take the MRT, dance and drink, then uber back to Sanxia or to Xinyi. Clubs appeared only when someone found a discounted entry, which was rare. On campus, **Mixology Club met Monday for theory and Thursday for shaker practice**.

## 5. Cultural Immersion

Mandarin and I reached a truce. I took the language class first semester and plateaued at survival phrases: ordering food, asking for directions, and thanking bus drivers. **I did not continue second semester.** Daily life relied on google translate, gestures, and patient locals. Food exploration filled the learning gap: scallion pancakes, dumplings, convenience-store food, bubble-tea, and rarely night markets (we were far). When money dropped, I splurged at Kura Sushi or burgers at BurBar.

## 6. Living Logistics

- **Monthly budget:** about **NT$10 000** (≈ €300) for food, transport, and entertainment.
- **Cheat code:** **AMPM diner** near campus – huge portions, student-friendly prices.
- **Transport:** **YouBike** handled almost every local trip. Tap EasyCard, ride for NT$10-20 per half hour, often grants the first 30 minutes free.
- **Commute to Taipei:** commuter buses covered the 50-minute ride. I kept hoping the Sanying MRT line would open early, but testing continues and official launch still reads "future".

## 7. Challenges and Growth

Adulting hit quickly: applying for the Alien Resident Certificate, translating sites with google translate. Bureaucracy was the biggest hurdle, but once stamped and sorted, daily life ran smoothly. Living solo taught financial planning. Regular presentations built confidence in public speaking and quick problem-solving-on-stage, skills pure coding rarely offers.

## 8. Tips for Future Exchange Students

1. **Talk to Taiwanese students, not just the international group.** Your semester becomes richer overnight.
2. **Keep your EasyCard loaded** and map YouBike stations early – it saves cash and time.
3. **Exploit old Sanxia's restaurants.** They are cheap, tasty. (should have done that more)

## 9. Conclusion

Choosing NTPU was the right call. I upgraded my presentation skill set, gained a foundational grasp of business concepts, and learned bartending to upgrade future house parties. Taiwan matched every positive thing I read: safe streets, brilliant night-market food, and sunsets from the food-court roof that stick in memory. If offered a rerun, I would accept, though I would ride into Taipei more often.
