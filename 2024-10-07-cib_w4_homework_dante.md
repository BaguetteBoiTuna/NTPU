# CiB W4 Homework

## Active Listening

### Skills/Strategies used and how they helped

Since I already move my head a lot when i am listening to someone, I tried to focus on questions and I noticed that conversations last longer and are more engaging. I also noticed that I am more focused on the conversation since i am trying to think of questions to ask next.

### Worse group work experience and how it could have been improved

Last year I had a pretty big project where multiple people had to do their own part of the work. The issue was that there was this one guy in the group that did not do anything (we had 3 months to work on the project). Kept not responding and saying he was going to work on his part and proceeded to not do anything. I tried to get this guy kicked from the group but the schools administration did not bother doing anything. At the end of the project we learned that the guy was on vacation far from France and even with this information the school did nothing.

If i could go back in time I would have just not let this guy join the group project because it was a lost case and a disaster trying to work with him.

## Writing rule and international etiquettes

### Writing rule

Avoid excessive use of exclamation points. While trying to emphasize on excitement or urgency, using too any exclamation points can have the opposite effect making it overly dramatic or sound insincere.

### French Dining Etiquette: Table Setting Rules

#### Correct Placement of Cutlery

In France, table setting is an important aspect of dining, especially during formal meals. Each piece of cutlery has its place:

- **Forks**: Left of the plate.
- **Knives**: Right of the plate, with blades facing the plate.
- **Spoon**: To the right of the knife if soup is being served.
- **Dessert Cutlery**: Placed above the plate or brought with the dessert.

When there is more than one set of cutlery, they are arranged in the order of use, starting from the outside and moving inward.
