# CiB W4 Homework

## Active Listening

### Skills/Strategies used and how they helped

Since I already move my head a lot when i am listening to someone, I tried to focus on questions and I noticed that conversations last longer and are more engaging. I also noticed that I am more focused on the conversation since i am trying to think of questions to ask next.

## Worse group work experience and how it could have been improved

Last year I had a pretty big project where multiple people had to do their own part of the work. The issue was that there was this one guy in the group that did not do anything (we had 3 months to work on the project). Kept not responding and saying he was going to work on his part and proceeded to not do anything. I tried to get this guy kicked from the group but the schools administration did not bother doing anything. At the end of the project we learned that the guy was on vacation far from France and even with this information the school did nothing.

If i could go back in time I would have just not let this guy join the group project because it was a lost case and a disaster trying to work with him.

## Writing rule and international etiquettes

### Writing rule

Avoid excessive use of exclamation points. While trying to emphasize on excitement or urgency, using too any exclamation points can have the opposite effect making it overly dramatic or sound insincere.

### French etiquette we forgot to mention

In France, since we eat with a fork, knife and spoon we have rules when it comes to setting up the table and placement of the cutlery. In fine dining there can also be duplicate cutlery for different courses and a plate and knife for the bread and butter.

- **Forks**: The fork(s) is placed on the left side of the plate.
- **Knives**: The knife(s) is placed on the right side of the plate.
- **Spoon**: If soup is served the soup spoon is placed on the right of the knife.
- **Dessert**: Dessert cutlery is generally brought out with the desert but if not it is placed above the plate.

When there is more then one set of cutlery, they are arranged in the order of use. Starting from the outside and moving inwards.
