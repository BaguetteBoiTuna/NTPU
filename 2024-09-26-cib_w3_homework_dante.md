# CIB W3 Individual Homework

## What consists of a good written report?

A good written report can be assessed differently depending on the perspective of the reader, purpose of the report, and the subject of the report.

### From a teachers perspective

- **Clear structure**: Teachers expect reports to be well-organized, with a clear introduction, body and conclusion. The information should be structured locally with the appropriate headings and subheadings.
- \*\*Correctness and academic rigor: Teachers often look for the accuracy of facts, good grammar and adherence to the guidelines of academic writing, including citation styles like APA or MLA.
- **Critical thinking**: They also value analysis and original thought. It's important to not just present information but to critically engage with it and show understanding of the material
