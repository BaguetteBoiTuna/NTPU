## What consists of a good written report?

A good written report can be assessed differently depending on the perspective of the reader, purpose of the report, and the subject of the report.

### From a teachers perspective

- **Clear structure**: Teachers expect reports to be well-organized, with a clear introduction, body and conclusion. The information should be structured locally with the appropriate headings and subheadings.

- **Correctness and academic rigor**: Teachers often look for the accuracy of facts, good grammar and adherence to the guidelines of academic writing, including citation styles like APA or MLA.

  - **APA (American Psychological Association) style**: Used in Social sciences, psychology, sociology and education. There are two formats: in-text citations and references list.
    - **In-text citations**: (Author, Year, page)
    - **References list**: Author's surname, initial(s). (Date Published). Title of source. Location of publisher: publisher. Retrieved from URL.
  - **MLA (Modern Language Association) style**: Used in humanities, arts, philosophy and literature. There are two formats: in-text citations and works cited.
    - **In-text citations**: (Author page)
    - **Works cited**: Author name(s). _"Title of source"_. _Title of container_, other contributors, version, numbers, publisher, publication date, location.

- **Critical thinking**: They also value analysis and original thought. It's important to not just present information but to critically engage with it and show understanding of the material

### From your (future) employer's perspective

- **Conciseness and relevance**: In a business environment, clarity and brevity are highly valued. Your boss is likely to prefer reports that are direct, with key points highlighted early on ( such as in an executive summary). The report should focus on actionable insights or recommendations.

- **Professional presentation**: A well-formatted report with attention to detail in design and layout is crucial. Charts, tables, and visuals may be used to support your findings.

- **Problem-solving**: Bosses often expect reports to not only present data but also suggest solutions or strategies for improvement.

### From people who don't know the subjects you write about

- **Simplicity**: For readers who are not experts in the subject matter, a good report should avoid jargon and explain concepts clearly. Including a glossary for technical terms can help.

- **Engagement**: Use visuals and real-world examples to make complex ideas more relatable. The report should guide the reader through the content without overwhelming them with excessive detail.

### Any differences or similarities between them?

- **Similarities**: All audiences value clarity, good organization, and a logical flow of ideas. Proper formatting and adherence to the purpose of the report are crucial for all readers.
- **Differences**: Teachers focus on academic rigor and depth of understanding, bosses prioritize actionable insights and brevity, and non-expert audiences need clear explanations and simple language. The tone and detail level should vary depending on the audience.

Each perspective require adapting the report to meet specific expectations, whether that's thorough analysis for teachers, concise problem-solving for bosses, or accessible explanations for a general audience.

### Parallel Structure

Parallel structure ensures that elements in a sentence that are alike in function are presented in a consistent way. When listing items or ideas, it's important to maintain the same grammatical form for clarity and flow. For example, in a list verbs should all be in the same tense and format.

- **Incorrect**: I like swimming, to run and reading books.
- **Correct**: I like swimming, running and reading books.

Parallel structure helps maintain readability and professionalism in writing, making it easier for the reader to follow your ideas.

## Share with us any international etiquette or country specific etiquette you have known or found

### French Etiquette

I recall 3 key etiquette rules from my childhood in France:

- **Greetings**: In France, it's common to greet each person individually either with a handshake or "la bise". "La bise" is a kiss on each cheek, starting with the left cheek. You are supposed to kiss the air near the cheek rather than actually making contact. When you leave you should say goodbye to everyone individually.
- **Dining etiquette**: In France, it's considered polite to keep your hands on the table during the meal, rather than in your lap. Also, it's customary to keep your hands above the table, not below it. Avoid having your elbows on the table. It's also polite to wait until the host starts eating before you begin. Lastly I noticed that not every family does this but you are supposed to eat with your mouth closed and to not do any sound when eating. Lastly if you are invited for dinner, it is customary to bring a small gift, such as wine, charcuterie or flowers.
- **Punctuality**: Being on time is only important for business meetings or rendezvous with people you don't know well. For social gatherings, it's common to be fashionably late. Arriving on time can be seen as over-eager or rude.
