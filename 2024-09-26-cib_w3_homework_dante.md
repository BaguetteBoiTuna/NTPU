# CIB W3 Individual Homework

## What consists of a good written report?

A good written report can be assessed differently depending on the perspective of the reader, purpose of the report, and the subject of the report.

### From a teachers perspective

### From your (future) employer's perspective

### From people who don't know the subjects you write about

### Any differences or similarities between them?
