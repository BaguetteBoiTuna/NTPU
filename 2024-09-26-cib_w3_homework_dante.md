## What consists of a good written report?

A good written report can be assessed differently depending on the perspective of the reader, purpose of the report, and the subject of the report.

### From a teachers perspective

- **Clear structure**: Teachers expect reports to be well-organized, with a clear introduction, body and conclusion. The information should be structured locally with the appropriate headings and subheadings.

- **Correctness and academic rigor**: Teachers often look for the accuracy of facts, good grammar and adherence to the guidelines of academic writing, including citation styles like APA or MLA.

  - **APA (American Psychological Association) style**: Used in Social sciences, psychology, sociology and education. There are two formats: in-text citations and references list.
    - **In-text citations**: (Author, Year, page)
    - **References list**: Author's surname, initial(s). (Date Published). Title of source. Location of publisher: publisher. Retrieved from URL.
  - **MLA (Modern Language Association) style**: Used in humanities, arts, philosophy and literature. There are two formats: in-text citations and works cited.
    - **In-text citations**: (Author page)
    - **Works cited**: Author name(s). _"Title of source"_. _Title of container_, other contributors, version, numbers, publisher, publication date, location.

- **Critical thinking**: They also value analysis and original thought. It's important to not just present information but to critically engage with it and show understanding of the material

### From your (future) employer's perspective

- **Conciseness and relevance**: In a business environment, clarity and brevity are highly valued. Your boss is likely to prefer reports that are direct, with key points highlighted early on ( such as in an executive summary). The report should focus on actionable insights or recommendations.

- **Professional presentation**: A well-formatted report with attention to detail in design and layout is crucial. Charts, tables, and visuals may be used to support your findings.

- **Problem-solving**: Bosses often expect reports to not only present data but also suggest solutions or strategies for improvement.
