- **geometric transformations**: translation, rotation, scaling, shearing.
- **Image Filtering**:
  - Low Pass Filter
  - High Pass Filter
  - Band Pass Filter.
- **Morphological Processing**: Dilation, Erosion, Opening, Closing.

### Image Analysis

- **Classification**: Assigning a label to an entire image.
- **Classification + Localization**: Assigning a label and a bounding box to an image.
- **Object Detection**: Labeling and locating multiple objects in an image.
- **Image Segmentation**: Labeling each pixel in an image.

## Deep Learning

A subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks to learn patterns from data. The term "deep" refers to the multiple layers in the network.

### Supervised Learning

Uses labeled data for training models.  
Examples:

1. **Image Classification**: Assigning a label to an image (e.g., "cat", "dog").
2. **Spam Detection**: Classifying emails (e.g., "spam", "not spam").

### Unsupervised Learning

Uses unlabeled data to find patterns.  
Examples:

1. **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns in the data.

## What is Digital Image Processing?

A digital image is a visual representation that is discretized in both space and intensity, making it easier to manipulate, store, and share compared to analog images. A two-dimensional digital image is composed of a matrix of pixels, with each pixel representing a specific color or intensity.

In mathematical terms:  
**F(x, y)** represents the intensity of the image at the pixel location (x, y), where:  
**Fr(x, y) + Fg(x, y) + Fb(x, y) = F(x, y)**, with **Fr**, **Fg**, and **Fb** representing the red, green, and blue intensity values, respectively.

## Analog vs Digital Image

### Analog Image

An analog image is a continuous representation, where the intensity of each point varies smoothly across space. Examples include photographs, paintings, and drawings.

### Digital Image

A digital image is discretized, represented by a grid of pixels, with each pixel holding a value that corresponds to its intensity or color.

**Computer Vision**: This is a field of computer science that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It involves algorithms and techniques to extract valuable data from images and videos.

- **Image and Video Analysis**: Extracting meaningful data from visual inputs.
- **Machine Learning**: Teaching computers to recognize patterns and learn from visual data.
- **Object Recognition**: Identifying objects within images or videos.
- **Scene Understanding**: Comprehending the broader context of a visual scene.
- **Applications**: Used in robotics, autonomous vehicles, surveillance, medical imaging, and more.

**Image Analysis** acts as a bridge between image processing and computer vision, enabling more advanced interpretation of visual data.

## Levels of Image Processing

### Low-Level Processing

Basic operations like noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and sharpening.  
**Image** → Low-Level Processing → **Image**

### Medium-Level Processing

Tasks such as segmentation and classification.  
**Image** → Medium-Level Processing → **Attributes**

### High-Level Processing

Complex tasks like object recognition, where the system makes sense of the visual information.  
**Attributes** → High-Level Processing → **Understanding**

## Fundamental Steps in Digital Image Processing (DIP)

1. **Image Acquisition**: Capturing an image using devices like cameras or scanners. This is the first step in digital image processing, where the raw image data is collected.
2. **Image Processing**: Enhancing and manipulating the image using various techniques, which may include:

   - **Color Image Processing**: Adjusting or manipulating the color information in the image.
   - **Wavelets and Image Transformations**: Using mathematical tools to transform images into different representations for better analysis.
   - **Compression and Watermarking**: Reducing image size for storage or adding watermarks for copyright protection.
   - **Morphological Processing**: Modifying the structure of objects in the image (e.g., dilation, erosion).
   - **Image Filtering and Enhancement**: Improving image quality by removing noise, adjusting brightness/contrast, etc.
   - **Segmentation**: Dividing an image into meaningful parts for easier analysis.
   - **Feature Extraction**: Identifying specific patterns or features in the image that are important for further processing.
   - **Image Pattern Classification**: Assigning labels or categories to different patterns within the image.

   **Output: Image Attributes**: These are the extracted features or meaningful information from the image, which are used for further analysis or applied in various fields such as machine learning, medical imaging, or object detection.
