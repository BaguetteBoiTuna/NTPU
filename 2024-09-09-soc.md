# SoC

A System on a Chip (SoC) is like having an entire computer on a single chip. Instead of separate components (like a CPU, memory, and graphics processor) being spread across different parts of a device, SoCs integrate all these components into one compact chip. This makes devices smaller, faster, and more power-efficient, which is why SoCs are commonly found in smartphones, tablets, and wearables.

For example, an SoC in a smartphone might include:

    CPU: The main brain of the device.
    GPU: Handles graphics and visual processing.
    Memory (RAM): Stores temporary data for quick access.
    Connectivity chips: For Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile networks.

By combining everything into one chip, SoCs reduce the amount of space and power required, leading to longer battery life and improved performance. However, because everything is so integrated, SoCs can't easily be upgraded or modified if one part fails.

SoCs are essential for mobile devices but are also found in things like gaming consoles, smartwatches, and even Internet of Things (IoT) devices
