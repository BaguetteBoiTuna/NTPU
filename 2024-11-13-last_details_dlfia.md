## Image sensing and acquisition

Many of the images we study or analyze are produced through the interplay of an "illumination" source and the "reflection" or absorption of energy from this source by the elements comprising the "scene" under observation.

The illumination source can vary and may include electromagnetic energy sources like radar, infrared, X-ray systems, ultrasound or even computer generated illumination patterns.
