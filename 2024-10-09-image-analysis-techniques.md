# Image Analysis Techniques

## Colorscales/Colormaps

Colorscales, or colormaps, are used in image analysis to visualize data effectively. Here are some common colormaps:

- **Grayscale**: Represents pixel intensity as shades of gray, from black to white. Useful for intensity-based images.
- **Jet**: A rainbow colormap (blue to red). Highlights differences but can be misleading.
- **Viridis**: Perceptually uniform and colorblind-friendly, transitioning from blue to yellow.
- **Plasma**: Similar to Viridis, with colors ranging from purple to yellow.
- **Magma**: Dark purple to yellow, good for emphasizing bright spots.
- **Hot**: Black to white through red, orange, and yellow. Useful for heat maps.
- **Coolwarm**: Blue for low values, red for high values. Good for divergent data.

## Cropping Techniques

Cropping is a fundamental operation in image analysis used to focus on regions of interest. One of the most common ways to crop an image is by using array indexing:

- **Array Indexing**: Images are represented as arrays, and specific regions can be selected by specifying index ranges. For example, to crop an image `img` to only include rows 50 to 150 and columns 30 to 120, use:

  ```python
  cropped_img = img[50:150, 30:120]
  ```

  This technique allows precise control over the portion of the image you want to retain.

Array indexing is a powerful tool for selecting specific areas of an image, enabling targeted analysis and manipulation.

## Visualizing Pixel Intensity Distribution

Visualizing pixel intensity distribution helps in understanding the contrast and overall brightness of an image. One common way to do this is by using a histogram:

- **Histogram**: A histogram shows the frequency of each intensity value in the image. For grayscale images, this provides an overview of how pixel intensities are distributed, helping to identify whether the image is underexposed or overexposed. To create a histogram, the image is typically flattened using a technique called **flattening**.

- **Flattening**: Flattening involves converting a multi-dimensional image array into a one-dimensional array. This is done using functions like `ravel()` to ensure all pixel values are considered together. For example:

  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  plt.hist(img.ravel(), bins=256, range=(0, 256))
  plt.xlabel('Pixel Intensity')
  plt.ylabel('Frequency')
  plt.title('Pixel Intensity Distribution')
  plt.show()
  ```

  Flattening helps in creating a single representation of all pixel intensities, which is useful for visualizing the overall distribution.

This visualization helps in adjusting image contrast and brightness effectively.
