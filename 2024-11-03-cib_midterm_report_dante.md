# Communication in Business Midterm Report: Adaptive Music in Video Games

## Introduction

### Definition of Adaptive Music

Adaptive music in video games is music that changes based on what's happening in the game.
Unlike traditional soundtracks (Music in video games are called soundtracks), it adjusts to events or actions, creating a closer connection between the player and the game.

### Importance of Music in Video Games

This subject is intriguing to me because it shows how even small details, like music, are crucial to building an immersive experience.
Just as a movie's music shapes emotions and heightens engagement adaptive music in games makes the experience feel more real and impactful, illustrating the importance of sound in creating memorable and dynamic worlds.

Research indicates that music in video games significantly influences player immersion and emotional responses.
A study published in [_The journal of Sound and Music in Games_](https://online.ucpress.edu/jsmg/article/2/4/13/118800/LudomusicologyNormalizing-the-Study-of-Video-Game) found that adaptive music enhances the gaming experience by aligning musical cues with gameplay events, thereby increasing player engagement and emotional resonance.

Moreover, adaptive music serves as a narrative device, guiding players through the game's story and reinforcing the emotional tone of various scenes.
For example, in the game _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild_, _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_ or _Skyrim_, the music dynamically shifts to reflect the player's actions and the environment, creating a cohesive and immersive experience.

Incorporating adaptive music into video games not only enhances immersion but also creates a more engaging and emotionally resonant experience for players.
Players often say that very immersive games are like movies, and the music is a big part of that.
