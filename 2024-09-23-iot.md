# Internet of Things (IoT)

**Overview**  
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical devices—embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies—connected to the internet to collect and exchange data. IoT enables devices to interact with each other and with centralized systems, making it foundational for various modern applications, from smart homes to industrial automation. Key aspects of IoT include real-time data collection, remote monitoring, and automated decision-making.

**Key Features**

- **Connectivity**: IoT devices communicate through various network protocols, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, [Zigbee](https://www.zigbee.org), and LoRaWAN.
- **Sensors**: These devices are equipped with sensors to monitor physical parameters such as temperature, humidity, and motion.
- **Data Processing**: Collected data is processed locally (edge computing) or sent to centralized servers (cloud computing).
- **Automation**: IoT systems can automate responses based on predefined rules or AI algorithms, improving efficiency and reducing human intervention.

**Applications**

- **Smart Homes**: Connected devices like thermostats, lights, and security systems that can be controlled remotely.
- **Healthcare**: Wearables and remote monitoring devices that track vital signs and provide real-time health data.
- **Industrial IoT (IIoT)**: Machinery and equipment connected to predictive maintenance systems in manufacturing plants.
- **Smart Cities**: Infrastructure like traffic lights, waste management systems, and public services connected for optimization and automation.

**IoT Architecture**
IoT systems generally follow a multi-layered architecture:

- **Perception Layer**: Comprises sensors and devices that collect data.
- **Network Layer**: Handles data transmission via the internet or other communication networks.
- **Application Layer**: Represents the end-user applications, such as smart home systems, healthcare monitoring, or industrial automation.

**Security Concerns**

- **Data Privacy**: With vast amounts of data being collected, privacy is a major concern for IoT systems.
- **Device Vulnerability**: IoT devices can be targets for hacking, especially if security protocols are weak or not updated.
- **Network Attacks**: IoT networks can be exposed to DDoS attacks or malware, affecting performance and functionality.
