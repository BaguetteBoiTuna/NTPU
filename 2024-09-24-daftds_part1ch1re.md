## Functional Safety Concept

IEC 61508 is an international standard that provides a framework for ensuring the functional safety of electrical, electronic and programmable electronic systems.

The key feature of IEC 61508 is the concept of [**Safety Integrity Levels (SILs)**](2024-09-24-sil.md), which categorize the required safety measures based on the likelihood and potential severity of system failures. There are four [SIL](2024-09-24-sil.md) levels, from [SIL](2024-09-24-sil.md) 1 (lowest safety level) to [SIL](2024-09-24-sil.md) 4 (highest), each associated with a progressively lower probability of dangerous failures.
